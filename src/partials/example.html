      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The ISS company develops storage and power systems that provide
          flexible control and optimal energy efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          We offer system operators, businesses, and individuals the ability to
          effectively manage their energy needs, contributing to the creation of
          a cleaner planet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our innovative energy storage technology allows for the separation of
          production from consumption, thus transforming the entire dispatch
          system and providing balance between traditional and alternative
          electricity generation.
